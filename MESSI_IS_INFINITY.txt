In 2008, there was a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal Both commentators were talking about Messi and then one commentator reveals that he was talking to Johan Cruyff and Johan Cruyff's prediction about Messi is that this player is so special that he will retire as the player with the most Ballon d'Ors in football history He must have 6, 7, 8 most Ballon d'Ors in football history and he predicted it when Lionel Messi's career just started Today Lionel Messi picked up his 8th Ballon d'Or The most in football history by far and it is no joke We have been spoiled Messi and Ronaldo have spoiled us I am legit telling you that this level of success can exist and they have normalized it They have legit normalized it Messi has picked up 8th Ballon d'Or Do you think that you would have told someone 30-40 years ago that there will be a football player who will pick up 8 Ballon d'Ors Would you believe it? No they would not If I tell you today that there will be a football player who will pick up 15 Ballon d'Ors He will pick up Ballon d'Ors for 15 years in his career Will you believe it or not? And that is how insane it sounds right now That Messi has picked up 8th Ballon d'Or If you would have told someone 30 years ago, it would have sounded as insane as 15 Ballon d'Ors Because it is that big of a thing It is that insane thing But is there anything that has not been said about Messi and I can say it? No, there is nothing like that There is nothing like that bro And it is just greatness Like we are privileged I am a Messi fan and I have literally enjoyed every moment with him And now I know that there will always be people who argue When Messi won the Argentina World Cup, there was a legendary commentary by Peter Durie There will always be people who argue There will always be people who differ And that is the reality That he will always be there bro You can never please everybody So it doesn't matter bro This video, I can please anyone But it is, if you don't like Messi So how can you not like Messi? But if you don't like Messi If you don't like this 8th Ballon d'Or, he did robbery, he did this, he did that See the reality is This Ballon d'Or was so peculiar It was so peculiar that both the players did everything that a player can do to win the Ballon d'Or Never ever I made a video, I will link it here You know I made that video 3 months ago And I said in that video that this will be the first time in football history That at one time a player has won the treble And has broken all the individual records And at the other time a legendary player like Messi has won the World Cup by leading his team The biggest trophy in football The only trophy that was lacking in that guy's career So there is no debate that Messi didn't deserve football No no no please Both of them deserved it Ok, now I will say this Both of them deserved it And I have this belief Messi should have been given a super Ballon d'Or Because I don't think that Messi and Ballon d'Or are winning after this If Messi and Ballon d'Or are winning after this Bellingham turning 23 I will wait for that But no wait Before we come to the future of Ballon d'Or What is the future of Ballon d'Or Which is a very interesting thing But before that we have to talk about Messi's Ballon d'Or Because there are arguments of many people Now see this is straight off the table That what Haaland did last year That was obvious That is insane Any player will do the same in any season He would win the Ballon d'Or There is no debate in this Until and unless that's Lewandowski And if French League is cancelled that year Then France Football's mind will be shaken And France Football will think Because French League is not done So Lewandowski should not have given Ballon d'Or That was the craziest thing And robbery And let me clear one more thing Messi doesn't do robbery For your kind information Messi doesn't do robbery Ok That is not a concept Messi doesn't rob Ballon d'Or from Haaland Messi doesn't go and tell French Football That give me Ballon d'Or This is mine Or Messi didn't say at the time of Lewandowski That don't give Ballon d'Or to Lewandowski Give it to me next year When I deserve it But then people will say That I robbed Lewandowski last year So that is Get that concept out of your head But Messi winning this Ballon d'Or I will tell you why it is special I don't know Maybe you are not able to fathom this thing But what you won in December last year You saw that in December last year That World Cup Maybe you are not able to contemplate that You are not able to process that But that was the biggest thing that has happened in football In recent history Past 50 years Past 50 years that was the biggest thing that has happened in football People don't realize that Lionel Messi winning World Cup with Argentina Is the biggest thing that has happened in this sport In so much time Because its magnitude was so big And let me tell you one thing Let me tell you one thing And you want to hear this If Ronaldo was there instead of Messi Then this would have happened That would have been the biggest thing of this sport I am telling you bro I am telling you If Ronaldo had won instead of Messi Then it would have been of this level And today The Messi you are lifting today You are seeing that Ronaldo would have also lifted the World Cup If his World Cup would have gone the same If he would have won the World Cup in the same way I am telling you He would have won it And that is the story of these players The things that these players have done in their career After that winning the World Cup In the fashion in which Messi won People say that Messi is given the banner because he won the World Cup In the fashion in which he won In every match, man of the match All those goals All those crazy assists That crazy goal against Mexico Other than that the way he plays on the pitch Like You know what Like everyone says Pep Guardiola says Thierry Henry says That Messi will win the Ballon d'Or every year Because Messi has the biggest advantage The way he plays football Go and see the goals of Haaland Which Haaland scored No doubt, nothing to take away from him But you know what Whenever you are making highlights of Haaland It will all be goals If you make a 10 minute highlight of a season of Haaland Out of that 9.5 minutes would be him scoring goals Simple as that And when you make a half an hour highlight of a season of Lionel Messi Out of that 10 minutes would be the part of goals The rest 20 minutes that he does That is what makes him the best player in the world But people don't get it Because people That is what makes him the best player in the world For that 10 minutes are nothing For that 10 minutes don't matter The rest 20 minutes that he does That is what makes him the best player in the world But we have said this many times People still think That Haaland is the best player in the world Haaland should have been given But Haaland Even if Haaland was given It wouldn't have been undeserving Because both of them deserved it But it is a beautiful storyline Wow man I love it But before going further I would like to say From here football gets diversified once again Now no more those two names Every year on the table Now they won't be there Until Cristiano Ronaldo does what he is doing And then he does it with Portugal And then Haaland wins I will be there no matter what Trust me Trust me I will be there no matter what I genuinely want that to happen I want to see Kylian Mbappe and Haaland 25-26 year old Kylian Mbappe and Haaland Holding their heads in the audience Because Ronaldo is picking up the ball and all That would be so poetic But now from here Hope, I mean After 1-2 years Genuinely You will see a different Ballon d'Or winner every year Every year Sometimes someone Sometimes someone Sometimes someone Musiala Sometimes someone Pedri Sometimes someone Saka Sometimes someone Mbappe Sometimes someone Haaland Sometimes someone suddenly Chakuwar at Skelia You will see such players Genuinely in football Because trust me none of these players I genuinely mean it No Haaland, No Mbappe None of them At max 3 Ballon d'Or At max 3 Ballon d'Or None of them is going to repeat it Like they did Like these two They have done it None of them have it None of them I genuinely mean it Guys, in the comment section Predict your next 5 Ballon d'Or Guys, this is such an interesting thing I am not in my mind Guys, do it Haaland Haaland 2 years Probably, he will win 2 out of 5 years Haaland, Haaland Mbappe will win once Once it is going to be between Musiala and Pedri Definitely And then 1 year it is going to be Union Alvarez It is going to be man I am telling you bro Tell me in the comments bro But okay bro Adios, Adios bro Lionel Messi man Lionel Messi I am privileged I am privileged to be a fan bro Yeah man Definitely I am honored That when I was a kid That 8 year old 9 year old Mark Karuni That Muktesh Sharma When he came from school He saw that match He saw the He saw Lionel Messi And he just fell in love with it He just fell in love with it man Best decision of my life Footballing wise Best decision of my life For real man Damn bro Damn My choice is gorted man Thank you so much
